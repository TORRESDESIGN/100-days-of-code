Howdy World! You are about to witness the journey of a soon-to-be dad take on the 100-day coding challenge. As of today January 4th, 2018 I shall commit to doing at least 1 hour of coding a day. I know this will be good for me, as practice makes perfect(or a good dev that is).
I will share my progress, and also share some of my internal thoughts & emotions, as I'm sure there will be capricious moments. Well it's now time to roll of my sleeves and start this journey.

<h2 align="center">Day 1: Thursday January 4th, 2018</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on a basic algorithm problem on Freecodecamp, challenge: Return Largest Numbers in Arrays. This is what the problem looks like:
```
<script>
function largestOfFour(arr) {
  // You can do this!
  return arr;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);
</script>
```

Howdy World! You are about to witness the journey of a soon-to-be dad take on the 100-day coding challenge. As of today January 4th, 2018 I shall commit to doing at least 1 hour of coding a day. I know this will be good for me, as practice makes perfect(or a good dev that is).
I will share my progress, and also share some of my internal thoughts & emotions, as I'm sure there will be capricious moments. Well it's now time to roll of my sleeves and start this journey.

<h2 align="center">Day 1: Thursday January 4th, 2018</h2>

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on a basic algorithm problem on Freecodecamp, challenge: Return Largest Numbers in Arrays. This is what the problem looks like:
```
<script>
function largestOfFour(arr) {
  return arr;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);
</script>
```
Basically I need to code an algorithm that loops through the multi-dimensional array & extracting the  largest number in each sub-array, and spit it out in it's own array, essentially this: [5,27,39,1001]

While working on this, I ran into an issue where my for loop was no working correctly, and after tyring to troubleshoot the issue time and time again, I discovered it was just a typo, freaking typo. I hate when that happens.:triumph:

I did not finish, but I hope to make better progress tomorrow.:smile:
Here's is my blueprint:
1.Loop through all the main arrays
2.If number is > 0 store it as var largestNum
3.Compare the next number vs var largestNum, if number is bigger, it takes it's place
4.Once it cycles through a sub array it stores the var largestNum and pushes that number onto var largestArray
5.Once it cycles through all the sub arrays, there should be 4 numbers
6.Join all those numbers into one array
7.if (Challenge completed){eat pizza};



**Thoughts:** This wasn't a very good start for me, I got pretty tripped up on that typo. I know this a harder challenge and it takes time, but I relish that satisfaction of when a problem is solved. I'm sure tomorrow will be much better.

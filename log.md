Howdy World! You are about to witness the journey of a soon-to-be dad take on the 100-day coding challenge. As of today January 4th, 2018 I shall commit to doing at least 1 hour of coding a day. I know this will be good for me, as practice makes perfect(or a good dev that is).
I will share my progress, and also share some of my internal thoughts & emotions, as I'm sure there will be capricious moments. Well it's now time to roll of my sleeves and start this journey.
